                <p>I have frequented this website as both a reader and editor, 
                    and have found the interface to be unintuitive on both fronts. 
                    I love The Indy and hope to better highlight the high quality work the paper produces. </p>

            <div class = "usability-issues">
                <p>i made observations about the usability in a few distinct categories:</p>
                <table style="width: 100%">
                    <tr>
                      <th>Usability </th>
                      <th>Efficiency</th>
                      <th>Learnability</th>
                      <th>Memorability</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td> The ability to navigate by “section” is hidden by a dropdown menu</td>
                        <td>There is no simple table of contents: in order to see all of the issue, one must scroll through the entire site</td>
                      <td> It is slightly difficult to understand how particular parts of the box bring people to an article </td>
                      <td>There is no way to store individual articles or bookmark to read later would could be a useful tool </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>It is also difficult to distinguish what is being clicked on because the individual sections do not have buttons</td>
                      <td>There is redundancy in the dropdown menu </td>
                      <td>Some links (apply, subscribe, alumni, donate) are dead </td>
                      <td>While navigation is standardized, there is no way to really return to where the user last came from </td>
                    </tr>
        
                  </table>
                  </div>
                  <div class = "accessibility">
                    <p> using WebAIM WAVE, I found the following accessibility issues: </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>
                            Redundant links: when clicking on an article, the whole box and text itself links to new pages 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Empty links: some of the links don’t go anywhere 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The all white background and boxes make it slightly difficult to distinguish the articles from the webpage 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I agree with the accessibility problems; a lot of the website has unintuitive linking and while that is frustrating as a user, 
                        I understand that can also pose accessibility issues for those relying on particular means of moving through the multiple pages. </p>
